        abouttext: "I had originally gotten my Associate's degree in IT from a local Community College. After little success in the job hunt, I decided to further my education with the UNC coding bootcamp. Currently, I am a server at Red Robin and have been for 2 years. Although I think writing code is a good challenge my dream job would be in music production. I love playing the piano and I am very interested in learning more instruments. I am a deeply motivated programmer, I love learning new things and continuing to challenge myself.",
